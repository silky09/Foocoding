  <h1>Homework JSON</h1>
    <p>
      Your friend Gudrun owns a small grocery store. She needs help managing her inventory. Write
      her two Javascript functions which, given a list of inventory items, return 1) the most
      expensive item, and 2) the cheapest item. The functions receive the inventory as a text string
      in JSON format, and should both return a text string containing an array of items (possibly
      only one item), in the same JSON format as the input. If there are several items with equal
      price, they should all be included in the array. You can assume that the input is always valid
      and in the same format, and its length isn't more than a few hundred items.
